# Art Attack

I don’t really know the first thing about art. My thoughts on most paintings I see are usually just some variant of “Oh, that looks good!” and the meaning and significance of them go over my head even if I specifically try to read about them. There are a few pieces however, that did spark some deeper thoughts and I really liked that I could have such reactions to art and specifically paintings. I often go back to some of these just to get that feeling and sense of connection again. With that in mind I thought I might revisit some of the art I like and specifically go through why I like it so much. I’m always happy to talk about things I like so it also makes sense that my first blog post would be something on those lines. There are a couple of paintings that I really got into and crafted whole narratives around them in my mind. There are a few more I really liked just as a concept but without much of a story attached to them. Hopefully in this post I can portray both to be as interesting as they are to me.

#### Contentment - Maxfield Parrish

I think this was one of the of the first paintings I connected with - not just looked at and appreciated but *really* connected with. Looking at this sent me back to college when we would all sit in one room at the end of the day and kill time. We might be talking to each other or just doing our own thing but everyone’s together winding down after dealing with whatever happened that day. My college years may not have been much to write home about but I appreciate these memories of casually spending time with my friends so much. Even when I look back at the time before college, when I was still in school, this kind of memory has always been what I’ve been most fond of. When I saw this painting, I instinctively put my friends and me in place of the two girls and imagined us sitting and chilling at the top of a mountain at sunset. Just imagining it gave me such happiness that I just stared at this painting for a good few minutes. I wanted to take in every detail of the mountains and the light falling on the girls just to imagine how it would be for us to be in that environment. It’s fitting that Maxfield Parrish named this painting Contentment. It's on my bucket list to experience this contentment in real life some day and not just in my head.

#### Untitled - Jean-Michel Basquiat

In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when there was all the protests and tension around the world, many social media accounts were putting up posts related to Black Lives Matter, police brutality, systemic racism, and just general support for the activists on the front lines of this fight. In that vein the [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/daily_paintings/) that introduces me to almost 100% of the art that I know, started posting paintings specifically by black artists and that’s how I came across this painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat.

When I first looked at this painting I saw a face with all sorts of vibrant colours filling up the space withing its outline. However, the longer I looked at it, the more I noticed the black in the painting. I kept staring and with each passing second, the black in the painting became increasingly pronounced to the point where it started to feel like the face was predominantly black with only a few streaks of the vibrant colours that I initially felt was the more prominent aspect of the face. The way my perception changed as I stared, made me feel like the bright colours were slowly being consumed by the black until there was hardly any left. This is where everything that was going on in the world led me to attaching my own story to this transition that I’d just seen. I know that I don’t have the first idea of what the black experience is like, but in my mind, it felt like a black man who, like any man, was completely unique from everyone else but all that uniqueness was hidden because the world around him saw him as just that and only that. He could fight this and in his fight, his own indvidual humanity and personality come out in small streaks of vivid colour but it would not be enough to erase the tag that the people around him have place on him.

With all this being said, I want to provide a disclaimer in the form of a quote from Daniel Sloss’ stand up special - Jigsaw.

>Just because you can find meaning in the art, doesn’t necessarily mean that was the meaning the artist necessarily intended to be there. Take into consideration that you might just be a pretentious fucking cunt, okay?

I’m fully aware that this quote applies to me just generally when it comes to what I think of paintings but almost certainly to what I think of *this* painting. I don’t know that this is what Basquiat wanted to convey when he painted this. It might well not be. I don’t know that I would have reached this conclusion if I saw the painting now for the first time instead of then when everything was fresh in my mind. I might well not have. Nonetheless, all the factors lined up for me to have this interpretation and on reaching it, I looked at the painting for even longer with a deep feeling of sadness for the man in the painting and regardless of how it happened, this painting told me a story that ended up moving me a great deal.

#### The Art of Conversation - Rene Margritte

I wouldn’t have thought anything of this one if I didn’t know the title. Once I read the title and then looked at the painting again it all made sense. It must be such a great feeling to be in a conversation that’s so engaging that you lose track of everything around you and are transported to somewhere else entirely. I imagine it would be even better to be able to give someone else that experience.


![Despair](despair.png)
#### Despair - Edvard Munch

This is another painting where the title is what tied everything together for me. Even though we can't see his any part of his face, I feel like the man's despair is very evident. The fiery skies and the passer-by looking back with concern all perfectly drive the point home. I feel like I get more from this piece the more I look at it.



One factor that makes me really appreciate a piece of art is hearing other people talk about why they like it. Listening to someone talk about the feelings they got when they first experienced art sometimes builds the bridge for me to enjoy it as well. I’ve previously tried to explain what drew me to my favourite art to my friends but was never able to find the right words to accurately capture what was in my head. I’m hoping taking the effort to write it all down might have been more successful in doing that. Although, even if nobody cared about any of this, it would be completely fine because I got the chance to be look back at things that I really enjoy and that’s enough of a win for me.
