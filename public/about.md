This blog is an attempt to try and pursue two of my hobbies - coding and writing - at the same time. The posts here are in a way a (not so) refined version of some of the things in my head. Hopefully, it all ends up making sense and at the same time doesn't wind up being some boring or bland text. Either way, I'm just doing this for fun so if you like reading this, great! If not, that's your personal problem. Don't ask me, I'm not a pro.

I had a name in mind for this blog but Heroku's random name generator came up with something much better so I decided to use that instead. Welcome to the **Stormy Escarpment** blog.
