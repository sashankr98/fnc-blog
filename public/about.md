This blog is an attempt to try and pursue two of my hobbies - coding and writing - at the same time. The posts here are in a way a (not so) refined version of some of the things in my head. Hopefully, it all ends up making sense and at the same time doesn't wind up being some boring or bland text. Either way, I'm just doing this for fun so if you like reading this, great! If not, that's your personal problem. Don't take it up with me, I'm not a professional.

The name for this blog is based on one of my first twitter account names and even though it wasn't very creative of unique, I liked it so I decided to use it here as well.
